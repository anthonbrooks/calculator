# Calculator

This project is a calculator that I built as a part of the Odin Project Curriculum. I set out to make a clone of the iPhone calculator and I intend to add more themes.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML is used to display the content on the page. Divs, ID's, and Classes are used to select buttons and content for reference in CSS and Javascript files.

CSS is used to style the Calculator. I want to add more themes so users can have a more personal experience. Also, adding more themes will give me more experience builing a single-page app. I want to add buttons for different displays and for the page to update without reloading.

Javascript is used to do Arithmetic and display the digits on the screen. With Javascript I select each button and assign them to variables so that they each have their own role and functionality. 

## Optimizations

*Optimizations will be made in the future as my knowledge of Javascript grows!*

## Lessons Learned:

Learning Javascript always seemed so daunting to me but I set out to learn it to the best of my ability in November of 2025. This project is initially published January 2026 and I have learned so much in this short period of time.

In the past I set out to learn Javascript but things would not stick for me. I started learning Python in 2019 in an Introduction to Python course at UC, San Diego. I made a chatbot, which is here on my Github, called the Virtual Magic Conch and that fueled my love of programming. From there I dove into web development with Ruby on Rails and Javascript but hit walls due to gaps in knowledge.

Today, January 10, 2026, doing this project has taught me how to style HTML with CSS, manipulate the DOM and create functions in Javascript to do basic math dynamically in the browser. The biggest lesson for me has been using querySelector(s) to select the buttons and display the numbers on the screen.
